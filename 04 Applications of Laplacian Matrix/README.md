# ðŸ”· Applications of Laplacian Matrix in Graph Theory

This notebook explores **three powerful applications** of the **Laplacian matrix** in graph theory and network analysis:

1. **Spectral Graph Partitioning**
2. **Graph Visualization using Laplacian Eigenmaps**
3. **Random Walks and Stationary Distributions**

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Graph Partitioning using Laplacian Matrix

### Goal
Minimize the number of edges (cut size $R$) between two node groups.

### Key Equations
- Cut Size:
  $$
  R = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i,j} A_{ij}(1 - s_i s_j)
  $$
- Laplacian Form:
  $$
  R = \frac{1}{4} s^T L s
  $$

### Spectral Bisection Algorithm
- Compute $L = D - A$
- Find the eigenvectors of $L$
- Use the **Fiedler vector** (second smallest eigenvector) to split nodes:
  - $s_i > 0$: Group 1
  - $s_i < 0$: Group 2

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Graph Visualization via Eigenvectors

### Objective
Minimize the total squared edge lengths in layout:
$$
\Delta^2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} A_{ij}(x_i - x_j)^2 = x^T L x
$$

### Method
- Compute the Laplacian matrix $L$
- Use:
  - Second smallest eigenvector of $L$ â†’ x-coordinate
  - Third smallest eigenvector of $L$ â†’ y-coordinate

This ensures connected nodes appear spatially close in the layout.

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Random Walks on Graphs

### Definitions
- $A$: Adjacency matrix
- $D$: Degree matrix
- $p(t)$: Probability vector at time $t$

### Transition Rule
$$
\mathbf{p}(t+1) = A D^{-1} \mathbf{p}(t)
$$

### Stationary Distribution
$$
\mathbf{p} = A D^{-1} \mathbf{p} \quad \Rightarrow \quad L D^{-1} \mathbf{p} = 0
$$

The long-term probability of being at node $i$ is:
$$
p_i \propto k_i
$$
Meaning: **nodes with higher degree are visited more often**.
