# 🧠 Graph Neural Networks Study Repository

Welcome to this curated repository dedicated to learning and implementing **Graph Representation Learning** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** using Python, NetworkX, NumPy, and related tools.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository is part of my ongoing journey to deeply understand and document core topics in graph learning — both theoretical foundations and practical implementations. It is also directly aligned with my **M.Sc. thesis**, which focuses on:

> **Brain Age Estimation Using Functional Graphs Derived from fMRI Data**.

The materials in this repo are aimed to benefit both myself and other researchers or enthusiasts who may be interested in this field.

---

## 🧪 Research Context

I am conducting my research under the supervision of **Dr. Gholamali Hosseinzadeh** in the **Brain Mapping Laboratory**, where I’m working on age prediction from brain data using graph-based methods.

Additionally, **Dr. Mansoureh Pakravan**, whose **Graph Neural Networks course** content is partially included here, is also serving as my **academic advisor** on this thesis.
